# C++ Tutorials

##### Switch Statement => SwitchStatement.CPP
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case. An example of switch statment on grading system.

##### Class => DateClass.CPP
Class is main block of Object Oriented programming.
DateClass.CPP is basic class example of a DATE which display user input date in user defind format.
##### Dynamic Array => DynamicArray.CPP 
A dynamically allocated array is declared as a pointer, and must not use the fixed array size declaration. Example of dynamic array used in a class to create a demo student information recording system. 

##### Constructor/Destructor => ConstructorDestructor.CPP
Constructor is a special function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class.
A destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever an object of it's class goes out of scope or whenever the delete expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class.

##### Composition => Composition.CPP
There are two basic subtypes of object composition: composition and aggregation. Composition.CPP is basic example of how to implement composition

##### Cardinality,Equality,Cartesian,Union,Intersection,Difference => SetOperations.CPP
The cardinality of a set is a measure of the number of elements of the set.
Equality of sets is defined as set A is said to be equal to set B if both sets have the same elements or members of the sets, i.e. if each element of set A also belongs to each element of set B, and each element of set B also belongs to each element of set A.
If A and B are two non-empty sets, then their Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pair of elements from A and B.
The union (denoted by ∪) of a collection of sets is the set of all elements in the collection.
The intersection A ∩ B of two sets A and B is the set that contains all elements of A that also belong to B. 
Differece of 2 given sets A and B is the set of all element in A, but not in B.
